# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore why they're so powerful and how to use them effectively.

## useState Hook

The useState hook is fundamental for managing state in functional components.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## useEffect Hook

useEffect helps manage side effects in your components.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(data => setUser(data));
  }, [userId]);
  
  return user ? <div>{user.name}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always include dependencies in useEffect
2. Keep hooks at the top level
3. Use custom hooks for reusable logic

Remember: Hooks must be called in the same order on every render!
