# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting journey that opens up countless opportunities in the digital world. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and tools you need to begin your web development journey.

## The Basic Building Blocks

### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. It provides the basic structure and content.

```html

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites look beautiful. It handles all the styling and layout.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
}
```
